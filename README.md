# 🛡️ FedMask — Privacy-Preserving Mask Detection using Federated Learning

A modern **Federated Learning-based Mask Detection System** that ensures **data privacy** while achieving high accuracy using a CNN model.

---

## 📌 Overview

FedMask is a **privacy-first AI system** designed for mask detection in healthcare environments.
Instead of centralizing sensitive data, it uses **Federated Learning (FedAvg)** to train models across multiple hospitals **without sharing raw images**.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

* 🔐 **Privacy-Preserving AI**

  * No raw image data leaves local nodes
  * Uses **Differential Privacy (ε = 0.5)**

* 🧠 **Federated Learning (FedAvg)**

  * Distributed training across multiple hospitals
  * Aggregation using weighted averaging

* 📊 **Interactive Dashboard UI**

  * Real-time training progress
  * Accuracy, loss, and metrics visualization
  * Node-wise performance monitoring

* 🎯 **Mask Detection System**

  * OpenCV-based face detection
  * CNN-based classification (Mask / No Mask)

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture

```
Hospitals (Local Training)
        ↓
   Model Updates (Δw only)
        ↓
Federated Server (FedAvg)
        ↓
 Global Model Distribution
```

* Each hospital trains locally
* Only **model weights** are shared
* Central server aggregates using **FedAvg**

---

## 🧠 Model Details

* Architecture: CNN (Conv2D + Dense)
* Input Shape: 64 × 64 × 3
* Output: 2 classes (Mask / No Mask)
* Optimizer: Adam
* Loss: Categorical Crossentropy

---

## 📊 Performance Metrics

| Metric    | Value |
| --------- | ----- |
| Accuracy  | 95.6% |
| Precision | 94.8% |
| Recall    | 96.2% |
| F1-Score  | 95.5% |

✅ Outperforms centralized training by **+2.2%**

## 🖥️ Frontend Dashboard

The project includes a **fully interactive UI dashboard** with:

* 📈 Training visualization (round-wise)
* 🏥 Hospital node monitoring
* 🔍 Live detection simulation
* 📊 Confusion matrix & comparison charts
